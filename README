A small firefox extension that binds '1' and '2' to 'previous tab' and 'next
tab', respectively - replicating the functionality found in the Opera browser.

To package the extension, run mkxpi.sh, or (if you lack a shell), create a zip
file containing the files in src/, and change the file extension to .xpi.

The addon is currently in the sandbox at AMO, and can be downloaded here:
