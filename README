A small firefox extension that binds '1' and '2' to 'previous tab' and 'next
tab', respectively - replicating the functionality found in the Opera browser.

To package the extension, run mkxpi.sh, or (if you lack a shell), create a zip
file containing the files in src/, and change the file extension to .xpi.

I will provide a download url for the extension here when (if) the extension
gets accepted into http://addons.mozilla.org.
